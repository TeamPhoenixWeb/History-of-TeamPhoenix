                <p>All of the 7members are not good at and they all are the same not a big difference</p>
                <p>28/9/2018 I have decided to start our team.</p>
                <p> start from 10th months I start moving out </p>
                <p> My goal is to win medals in the foreign country this is our goals</p>
                <p> 14/9/2018 We haven't created TeamPhoenix yet but I always go to the skate rink and share with them </p>
                <p> around the 9th month our skate ring got a power cut off so we are have to stop our training but <br>I saved money to buy my own lamp and share it with others and after that day we are back to our training and we have to hide our lamp behind the lockers but the next day when 
                    I arrive I founded that Someone pees on it so we have to wash it back</p>
                <p>At 16.Nov.2019 the power and light came back</p>
                <p>at 3.Oct.2018, We fixed our skate ring back it cost around 500k I got help from our member's parents.</p>
                <p>17. Nov.2018, I couldn't even sleep, I was thinking about  Phoneix feature plan and Training, we usually do our training every day, every month, and around the 12th month our team started to family with physical but not very, after all, I have thought that I did everything and the only problem is with that we didn't have competition so they didn't have any experience,</p>
                <p>Sometimes I was wondering that if I am rich I want to give sponsor and build my own skate rink. Luckily our team got some sponsors from Phoenix Skate shop </p>
                <p>around the 10th month, a guy name call "ya thu" join our team, and he becomes the best player in our team within a short period of time I even decide to go to training with him in Bangkok, I call him to camp which has between 10th month and 12th month he only comes 4days and I give him another chance and call him back but he went to a show party without telling to me and I kick him because rules are rules.., After that there is no one to come with me so I have to go alone and the time that I realized is I am not getting any sponsors to go training but my dad even give me 1millions to go training but that's money is just for extra money I can not spend.... but When I was in training Ko Htet call me that Our Team becomes a Department and I(ShanLay) hired to become a head of the coach, I finish my planing at a march and I even update training and we do a lot of training at the end of the 7th month the guys name call "pyae phyo thu" "pyae nyein aung" we hire hem as a test member. Our Team Phoenix starts our local trip in 4th month of May Myo and we show a demo sadly there is no one but we never give up.</p>
                <p>after all, a guy name 9D has come to us, and around 3.4.2019 we go to another town "wan twin" We even show a demonstration there, but there are more people than last time. </p>
                <p>and we have a water festival and I was planning to do a competition and 9D was offered for that as well so we have decided to do it and our members can also have some competition experience and also remember all are still too young and we got another member call "kyaw su thway"  and "ko ko win" when i read them a rules everything fine expect one rules "no having girlfriends" they try their best and try not to break it, our team is now at </p>

                    8.pyae phyo thu<br> 
                    and me (shan lay)
                    </p>
                <p>The other 3 guys are retired, one guy break a rules, one guy was retired because of their family and another guy was retired because he got a job, </p>
                <p>Since I arrive from Bangkok I make more rules and try to make it the perfect team. Around May, "pyae phyo thu" who is one of the good players in my team got kicked out for broking rules.I am kind of nervous because we are already low on member but if i reduce a rules our team can even disband so i dont want to do it and i start making more rules because more rules more success. Around July we got informed that we can go to the thailand competition, As i know i start making camp with phoe thar,Phwe Phwe, Shoon lal,me(shanlay),ko ko win,kyaw su thway,ZwePyae, i inform their parents that we are not getting sponser and we have to go with our money and their parents even accept it becuase their parents want to know how hard is it and want to get them more experience.
